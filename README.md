Until recently, we had absolutely no idea how to create websites and our knowledge was limited to some basic information obtained from computer science classes (lol). However, now we are working on the biggest project of our lives (at the moment). It is truly exciting and interesting! We gain so much experience that cannot be obtained just by watching videos or reading books. This is real-life experience. We encounter problems and solve them, and most importantly, we have a very non-toxic and flexible work schedule that does not demotivate or cause burnout. Perhaps it's not the most productive schedule, but the main thing is that it produces results (somewhat contradictory).

Info about the site:

This is a test development of a website for the sale of ritual goods, where you can find a catalog of the goods offered and contact the seller for more information.

Ritual goods are goods that are used for funeral rites and commemoration of the deceased. Among them we can highlight the coffins, wreaths, crosses, clothes for burial, candles, ribbons, etc.

Will improve over time. I guess.
