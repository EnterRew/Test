This is a test development of a website for the sale of ritual goods, where you can find a catalog of the goods offered and contact the seller for more information.

Ritual goods are goods that are used for funeral rites and commemoration of the deceased. Among them we can highlight the coffins, wreaths, crosses, clothes for burial, candles, ribbons, etc.

Will improve over time. I guess.
